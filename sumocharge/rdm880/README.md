The files rdm800.py, LICENCE.txt & test.py are from [this revision of "rfid" by Jeremy Grosser](https://github.com/JeremyGrosser/rfid/tree/b55610e3c55dabfb234590c4fd43fcee030d1057).

Everything else is to assist in using this code in sumo-charge.

I think this is fair re-use/attribution but if you feel differently please let
